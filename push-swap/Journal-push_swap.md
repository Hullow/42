- Started reading about project ([Wikipedia: Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)))
- Wrote outline for input and error handling

# 10/5/24
- Implemented input handling, more

# 12/5/24
- Looked at algorithms: [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) (see also [here](https://www.kirupa.com/sorts/quicksort.htm)), [turk](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97)
- Lucas writes to me to ask how it's going and suggest a few things:
	- struct for each stack
	- struct full_stack
	- do_action(func action, overarching_stack)
- Did structs and input handling
- ft_push_b: need to simplify it, moving an element in a linked list is simple.<br>
