## Access control
### Mandatory access control

^ccbb7a

> An access control policy that is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of an information system. A subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the following: 
> 	(i) passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;
> 	(ii) granting its privileges to other subjects;
> 	(iii) changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or system components;
> 	(iv) choosing the security attributes to be associated with newly-created or modified objects; or
> 	(v) changing the rules governing access control.
> Organization-defined subjects may explicitly be granted organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects) such that they are not limited by some or all of the above constraints.
