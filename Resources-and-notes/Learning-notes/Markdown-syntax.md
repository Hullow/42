### [Tables in markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown/tables)
A table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns.

To add a table in Markdown, use the vertical line | to separate each column, and use three or more dahses --- to create each columnâ€™s header. A vertical line should also be added at either end of the row.

| Month    | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January  | $250    |
| February | $80     |
| March    | $420    |

The output would look like:

Month	Savings
January	$250
February	$80
March	$420
Cell widths can vary, as shown below:

| Month | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January | $250 |
| February | $80 |
| March | $420 |

The output will look exactly the same.


Text Alignment
Align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon : to the left, right, or on both side of the dashes --- within the header row.
