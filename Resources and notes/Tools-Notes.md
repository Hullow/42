# Notes on tools

## VS Code
### [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
- **Launch** versus **Attach** configurations: two core debugging modes
  - **Launch** starts the app or process in debug mode before VS Code attaches to it
  - **Attach** connects VS Code's debugger to an app or process that's already running 

## Github
**Private repos and subscriptions**
Each personal account uses either GitHub Free or GitHub Pro. All personal accounts can own an unlimited number of public and private repositories, with an unlimited number of collaborators on those repositories. If you use GitHub Free, private repositories owned by your personal account have a limited feature set. You can upgrade to GitHub Pro to get a full feature set for private repositories. For more information, see "GitHubâ€™s plans."
