# 1/2/24
- Started project:
	- read subject and took notes about concepts  (static variables, read & open functions, I/O system calls, EOF, the required preprocessor flag ...)
	- played with the open() and read() functions with examples borrowed from the web (see *read-open.c*) 
	- started writing an outline of the function and its components, including pseudocode
