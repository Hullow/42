# Notes on C

## Pointers
### Void Pointers
**Benefits and Applications**
- Memory allocation: used to allocate memory dynamically in conjunction with malloc and calloc without specifying the data type beforehand
- Generic data structures: allows the creation of data structures that can handle various data types, such as linked lists and queues
- Callback functions: have a use in implementing callback mechanisms effectively, to transfer both function pointers and related data.
- Interfacing with external libraries: allow to communicate with external libraries or functions of the system by allowing data to be passed without having to define its precise type.
